# Project to extract the phone number and email address 

'''
STEPS TO FOLLOW

•    Get the text off the clipboard.
•	 Find all phone numbers and email addresses in the text.
•	 Paste them onto the clipboard.
•    Now you can start thinking about how this might work in code. The 
•    code will need to do the following:
•	 Use the pyperclip module to copy and paste strings.
•	 Create two regexes, one for matching phone numbers and the other for 
     matching email addresses.
•	 Find all matches, not just the first match, of both regexes.
•	 Neatly format the matched strings into a single string to paste.
•	 Display some kind of message if no matches were found in the text
